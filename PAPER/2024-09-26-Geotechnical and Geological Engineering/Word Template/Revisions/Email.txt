COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR:

Reviewer #2: The research work is based on pure theoretical derivation and simulation analysis. Many mature commercial software has good calculation and analysis functions. Therefore, the innovation of the research work is insufficient, and the practical guiding role of the project is insufficient. In addition, there are too many sections and too long length. It is suggested to carry out targeted research on an innovative problem to avoid lengthy discussion. Unfortunately, the existing manuscript cannot be supported.


Reviewer #5:
In this manuscript, the authors study rock deformation in twin tunnels with a transverse gallery, considering plasticity and time-dependent constitutive models. After reviewing the manuscript, I believe the following questions should be addressed in the revised version:
1)    The title could be changed to "Evaluation of Rock Deformation in Twin Tunnels with a Transverse Gallery, Considering Plasticity and Time-Dependent Constitutive Models."
2)    Is the twin tunnel mentioned in Section 5 an actual case study? If so, the geotechnical properties, as well as details regarding the size, excavation method, and lithological units of the study area, should be provided.
3)    Which software was used for simulating the tunnel?
4)    How was the numerical model calibrated?
5)    How were the results of the numerical simulation verified?
6)    The support systems of the tunnels and gallery should be clearly presented in a specified table.
7)    The boundary conditions, assigned material properties, and model size should be illustrated in the text.
8)    How were the normal and shear stiffness between the initial and secondary support systems considered in the model?





Reviewer #6: The paper is good and worthy explaining the finite element analyses of the  twin circular tunnels deformation mechanisms taking into account the visco-elasto-plastic behavior of the surrounding rocks. the following comments are suggested:

1- Title of the paper may be revised as the numerical modelling analyses are based on the FEM. For example the following title is suggested: "A three-dimensional finite element analysis of the rock deformation mechanisms in twin circular tunnels with a transverse gallery based on visco-elasto-plastic constitutive models".

2- The English of the abstract may be rechecked. Some lengthy and somewhat repetitive sentences exist.

3- The  theoretical background and literature review on the stress analyses around rock tunnels may be improved. For example see the following papers:

4-The explanations for Figures' captions may be improved, For example the caption of Figs. 11 is very concise. It may be divided into two parts (a) and (b) for the two figs, and explain them individually., The same is true for Figs. 19 and Figs. 20, etc..
 


Reviewer #7: This paper conducted numerical analysis of the rock deformation in twin tunnels with transverse gallery. Overall, this paper is interesting. The following comments are for the authors to consider. After revision, I think this paper can be published.
(1) In the introduction, the authors mentioned that tunnels are widely used and in the underwater environment. Therefore, the latest research regarding the interaction between rock mass around tunnels and water is recommended to be added (10.1016/j.engfailanal.2024.109137).
(2) For the fundamental assumptions, this section can be shortened.
(3) Please further check whether some equations or figures should be cited in Section 3, such as Figure 1 and Equation (2).
(4) The above comment is also applicable to section 4.
(5) When author mesh the geometry to the corresponding number of elements, which guideline did the authors follow? I mean how did the authors determine the corresponding number of elements?
(6) The authors conducted a comprehensive analysis and parameter study. However, it will be better to compare the numerical study with some in-situ tunnelling cases. I understand that the fundamental research will be quite difficult to have certain in-situ tunnelling cases. Therefore, this is a recommendation for the authors to consider.
