This paper aims to demonstrate the long-term implications of the rheological constitutive behavior of rock mass and concrete lining in the convergence profile of the twin tunnels with transverse galleries using a three-dimensional numerical analysis based on the finite-element method. Various constitutive models are considered for the rock mass, including elastic, elastoplastic, viscoplastic, and elastoplastic-viscoplastic. The definition of plasticity incorporates a Drucker-Prager yield surface and an associated flow rule without hardening or softening. Viscoplasticity is based on the Perzyna model, also using a Drucker-Prager flow surface. For the lining, elastic and viscoelastic constitutive models are adopted. The viscoelastic behavior is defined by a Generalized Kelvin rheological model, formulated based on the Solidification Theory of Bazand and Prassanann, with parameters given by CEB-FIP MC90 formulations. The deactivation-activation method simulate the excavation process. The numerical model is verified using comparisons with analytical solutions in elasticity and elastoplasticity for twin tunnels without a gallery developed by other authors. The mutual interaction between the longitudinal tunnels through parametric analyses is investigated, emphasizing the impact of the concrete lining stiffness on tunnel convergences. The interaction is particularly significant for longitudinal tunnels, especially when they are spaced at four radius. With a transverse gallery and considering the lining, we observe a highly localized influence in twin tunnels, extending up to four radius on each side of the gallery axis. Comparisons of convergence reveal that the viscous effects of the rock mass and the lining significantly influence the peak convergence within the intersection zone, resulting in differences of approximately 10\% in convergence values.


%This paper aims to demonstrate the long-term implications of the rheological constitutive behavior of rock mass and concrete lining in the convergence of the intersection area of twin tunnel galleries using a three-dimensional numerical analysis based on the finite-element method. A Drucker-Prager-Perzyna elasto-plastic-viscoplastic constitutive law represents the rock mass and, for the lining, an elastic and viscoelastic law. The deactivation-activation methods simulate the excavation process. The numerical model is verified using comparisons with analytical solutions in elasticity and elastoplasticity for twin tunnels without a gallery developed by other authors.

%É necessário um resumo conciso e factual. O resumo deve indicar sucintamente o objetivo da investigação, os principais resultados e as principais conclusões. O resumo é frequentemente apresentado separadamente do artigo, pelo que deve ser autónomo. Por esta razão, as referências devem ser evitadas, mas se forem essenciais, devem citar-se o(s) autor(es) e o(s) ano(s). Além disso, devem ser evitadas abreviaturas não padronizadas ou pouco comuns, mas se forem essenciais, devem ser definidas na primeira menção no próprio resumo. Os artigos com "Sugestões de Métodos" não devem conter resumos.
