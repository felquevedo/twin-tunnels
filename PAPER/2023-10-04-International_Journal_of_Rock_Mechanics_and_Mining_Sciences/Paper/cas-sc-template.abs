Resorting a three-dimensional finite element analysis, this paper investigates the instantaneous and long-term implications induced by the time-dependent constitutive behavior of constituents on the convergence profile of twin tunnels linked with transverse galleries. Several constitutive models for rock mass mechanical behavior are examined at the material level, encompassing elastoplasticity, viscoplasticity, or coupled elastoplasticity-viscoplasticity frameworks. Plasticity state equations are based on a Drucker-Prager yield surface with an associated flow rule, while the viscoplasticity formulation relies on the Perzyna model with a Drucker-Prager flow surface. Tunnel lining behavior is modeled using either elastic or viscoelastic constitutive models. The viscoelastic behavior is described by a Generalized Kelvin rheological model based on Bazant and Prassanann's Solidification Theory, with model parameters derived from CEB-FIP MC90 formulations. From a computational viewpoint, the deactivation-activation method is employed to simulate the excavation process and lining installation. The accuracy of finite element predictions is assessed through comparisons with available analytical solutions formulated in a simplified setting for the twin tunnels' configuration. A parametric study delves into the mutual interaction induced by tunnels proximity, emphasizing the crucial role of concrete lining stiffness in twin tunnels' deformation. Numerical simulations indicate a highly localized influence of a transverse gallery on twin tunnels deformation, extending up to four radii from each side of the gallery axis. Finally, the paper investigates the effects of twin tunnels proximity and those induced by an interconnecting gallery on the instantaneous and long-term convergence of tunnels, contrasting these outcomes with the convergence of a single tunnel.
