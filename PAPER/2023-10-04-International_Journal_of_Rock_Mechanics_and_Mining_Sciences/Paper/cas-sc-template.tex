\begin{abstract}
This paper aims to demonstrate the long-term implications of the rheological constitutive behavior of rock mass and concrete lining in the convergence of the intersection area of twin tunnel galleries using a three-dimensional numerical analysis based on the finite-element method. A Drucker-Prager-Perzyna elastoplastic-viscoplastic constitutive law represents the rock mass and, for the lining, an elastic and viscoelastic law. The deactivation-activation methods simulate the excavation process. Comparisons of convergence reveal that the viscous effects of the rock mass and the lining significantly influence the peak convergence within the intersection zone, resulting in differences of approximately 10\% in convergence values.

\section{Introduction}\label{}

The structural design of deep twin tunnels involves estimating cross-section convergence, lining pressure, and the size of the plastic zone within the rock mass caused by the excavation process. The final convergence and stress field around the tunnel depend on \textit{in situ} initial stresses, cross-section geometry, and the coupling between the lining and the rock mass during construction. Unlinke a single tunnel, the proximity between twin tunnels break the symmetry of deformations in tunnel wall. Many twin tunnels have transverse galleries that serve as emergency routes. These galleries will introduce a local effect on the convergence profile of the longitudinal tunnel. 

Additionaly, the rheological behavior of the rockmass and lining plays a crucial role in how stress and displacements fields evolve over time.

%Many studies have proposed viscous constitutive models for the rock mass. Some of these models use instantaneous linear elastic behavior. However, more and more studies have analyzed the impact of instantaneous elastoplastic behavior with viscous long-term components [\citenum{rousset1988}, \citenum{piepi1995}, \citenum{Purwodihardjo2003}, \citenum{Kleine2007}, \citenum{Shafiqu2008}, \citenum{Barla2010}, \citenum{souley2011}, \citenum{Manh2015}]. Incorporating elastoplastic behavior has a more apropriate representation of rock mass since the stress state can reach plasticity during excavation. These coupled models are better in regions with high-stress deviations where plasticity-induced stress redistribution will impact the viscous component.

%Despite these developments, there are few studies about the interaction of the rheological behavior of the lining with viscous rock mass [\citenum{pottler1990}, \citenum{meschke1996}, \citenum{mavsin2009}, \citenum{NEUNER2021}]. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of some of the main parameters of deep concrete-lined tunnels in long-term convergence.

\section{Fundamental assumptions}\label{}

Despite the generality of the models, we employ some delimitations in this work:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item It is assumed only deep tunnels, neglecting surface influences such as deformations caused by surface loads and settlements arising from the excavation process;

\item Although the inherent complexity of the rock mass's behavior, is influenced by spatially varying properties, this study opts for a simplified representation: a homogeneous and isotropic medium. While the rock mass may exhibit discontinuities, we simplify its overall behavior by treating it as a continuous medium. Consequently, the rock mass is considered single-phase and phenomenologically modeled using an elastoplastic-viscoplastic rheological law to capture instantaneous and long-term responses. This approach excludes considerations of other factors, such as temperature gradients, water flow, and pore mechanics;

\item Despite the complexity of the internal stress state of a massif, due, for example, to the discontinuities, anisotropy, and heterogeneity of the materials, equal vertical and horizontal stresses will be used, thus dealing with a geostatic-hydrostatic initial stress state.

\item Twin tunnels are typically constructed with a time lag between the excavation fronts. In this work, we will excavate synchronously, employing symmetry conditions to reduce computer processing time.

\item It is common to design twin tunnels with a time lag between the excavation fronts. In this work, we will perform synchronous excavation, using symmetry conditions to minimize computer processing time.

\item In contrast to the variable conditions present in tunnel construction, where the excavation speed and lining installation fluctuate during the construction process, we adopt a constant speed for full, flat, and vertical excavation with homogeneous concrete lining with constant thickness. It's considered a constant humidity and temperature in the concrete lining.

\item We will not consider dynamic excitations (involving earthquakes and explosions, for example) and inertial terms (density and acceleration). In other words, the evolution of deformations occurs in a quasi-static manner. We also adopt the hypothesis of small perturbations.

\end{enumerate}

%The results of this study apply only when the following hypotheses are satisfied:

%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

%\item tunnel with circular cross section;
%\item full, flat, and vertical excavation face without using presupport
%techniques;
%\item constant excavation speed;
%\item homogeneous concrete lining with constant section;
%\item initial state of hydrostatic radial stresses and constant normal
%stress equal to the radial stresses along the depth;
%\item the rock mass must have a perfect viscoplastic behavior, independent of hydrostatic stresses;
%\item constant humidity and temperature in the concrete lining during
%the creep evolution;
%\item perfect adhesion (rigid contact) between lining and rock mass
%interface;
%\item concrete lining stress level below 40\% of the average compressive strength; this is limited so that the superposition principle of
%the CEB-FIP MC90 creep model remains valid.

\section{Constitutive Model of the Rock Material}\label{}

An elastoplastic-viscoplastic constitutive model was implemented in ANSYS using the UPF/USERMAT customization tool [\citenum{ANSYS:2013b}] to simulate rock mass.  This model concern a serial association of the plastic and viscoplastic constitutive models, i.e., the total strain $\dstrain = \dstraine + \dstrainp + \dstrainv$, which leads to the following linear constitutive relationship:
\begin{equation} \label{eq_constitutive_relationship_epvp}
	\dstress = \Dll : \dstraine = \Dll : (\dstrain - \dstrainp - \dstrainv),\;
\end{equation}
where $\dstraine$, $\dstrainp$ and $\dstrainv$, represent the elastic, plastic and viscoplastic strain rate, respectively and $\Dll$ denote the fourth-order isotropic elastic linear constitutive tensor. The one-dimensional representation in Fig.~\ref{reological_scheme} shows this association. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{Rheological representation.pdf}
	\caption{Rheological representation of the elastoplastic-viscoplastic model.}
	\label{reological_scheme}
\end{figure}
In this model is used a Drucker-Prager plastic flow surface given by
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:f_Drucker_Prager}
	f(\stress,q) = f(I_1,J_2,q) = \beta_1 I_1 +\beta_2 \sqrt{J_2}-q(\alpha),
\end{equation}
which $I_1$ is the first invariant of the stress tensor, $J_2$ the second invariant of the deviator tensor and $\beta_1, \beta_2$ and $q(\alpha)$ are strength parameters related to the friction angle $\phi$ and cohesion $c(\alpha)$, respectively. In the present model Drucker-Prager surface been inner of the Mohr-Coulomb surface [\citenum{bernaud1991}], that is,
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:f_DP_inscrita_MC}
	\beta_1 = \dfrac{(k-1)}{3}, ~~~ \beta_2 = \dfrac{(2k+1)}{\sqrt{3}}, ~~~
	q(\alpha) = 2\sqrt{k}~c(\alpha),
\end{equation}
where $k = (1+\sin{\phi})/(1-\sin{\phi})$. The internal variable $\alpha$ is the equivalent plastic strain $\straineqp$ used to simulate strain hardening/softening phenomena. However, for this study, we adopt perfect plasticity, meaning that c is a constant. For the viscoplasticity surface $f^{vp}$ the same surface is empolyed, but with $\phi^{vp}$ in $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, and $q^{vp} = 2\sqrt{k^{vp}}-c^{vp}$ where $k^{vp} = (1+\sin{\phi^{vp}})/(1-\sin{\phi^{vp}})$ and $c^{vp}$ is a constant, i.e., perfect viscoplasticity. 
The plastic flow rule is given by:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq_plastic_flow}
	\dot \strainp = \left\{ 
	\begin{array}{ll} 
		\dot \lambda \dfrac{\partial g}{\partial \stress} &  \text{for } f > 0 \\ 
		\zerol, & \text{for } f \le 0 \\
	\end{array}\right.,
\end{equation}
where $\dot \lambda$ is the plasticity multiplier and $g$ is a potencial flow analogous to $f$ to simulate the volume dilatation during the evolution of plastic deformations. However, for this analysis, was used associated plasticity, i.e., $g=f$. The plastic multiplier is obtained through the consistency condition $\dot f = 0$. Numerical details of this implementation can be found in [\citenum{quevedo2022b}]. For viscoplastic flow rule we have,
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq_viscoplastic_flow}
	\dstrainv = \dot \lambda^{vp} \dfrac{\partial f^{vp}}{\partial \stress}
\end{equation}
In contrast to the plastic multiplier, the viscoplastic multiplier $\lambda^{vp}$ is independent of a consistency condition. As a result, its expression is explicit. For this study, we utilize the Perzyna model as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq_perzyna_model}
	\dot \lambda^{vp} = \dfrac{\Phi(\stress,q^{vp})}{\eta}~~~\text{and}~~~\Phi = \left\langle  \dfrac{f^{vp}(\stress,q^{vp})}{f_0} \right\rangle^n, \,
\end{equation} where $\Phi$ is the overstress function, $\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity constant, $n$ is the dimensionless parameter that gives the form of the power law, $f_0$ a parameter conveniently adopted and $\left\langle * \right\rangle$ is the McCauley function which is $0$ when $* <0$ , i.e. viscoplastic flow will only occur when the overstress function is positive.

In this coupled model, when $\phi=\phi^{vp}$, cohesion entirely controls the evolution of local mechanical fields. Specifically, when  $c \rightarrow \infty$ and $c^{vp} \rightarrow \infty$, the system achieves a purely elastic solution. The solution becomes purely elastoviscoplastic with $c \rightarrow \infty$, while a pure elastoplastic solution emerges with $c^{vp} \rightarrow \infty$. In this study's coupled analysis, we have adopted $c^{vp} < c$, allowing the viscoplastic domain to occur without plasticity. However, in the presence of plasticity, viscous effects become inevitable. Fig.~\ref{epvpdomains} illustrates these domains in principal stress space.

\section{Constitutive Model of the Lining}\label{}

We implemented a viscoelastic model in ANSYS using the UPF/USERMAT customization feature [\citenum{ANSYS:2013b}]. The model simulates concrete creep through a Generalized Kelvin chain, based on Bažant and Prasannan's Solidification Theory [\citenum{bazant:1989a,bazant:1989b}], with parameter adjustments performed using the CEB-FIP MC90 formulation. The CEB-FIP MC90 formulation also [\citenum{CEB:1993}] determines the shrinkage component. 

In this model, the constitutive relationship between stress and strain is 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:8}
	\dstress = \Dll : \dstraine = \Dll : \dstrain - \Dll : \dstrainsh - \Dllmod : \dstraincr\;
\end{equation}
where $\dstrainsh$  and $\dstraincr$ are the shrinkage and creep strain rate, respectively, while $\Dll$ and $\Dllmod$ denote the fourth-order isotropic elastic linear constitutive tensor and modified constitutive tensor that incorporates the aging of the concrete, respectively. Due to the time integration scheme for the Newton-Raphson algorithm, the Eq.~(\ref{eq:8}) is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:9}
	\stress_{n+1} = \stress_{n}+\Dll : \Delta \strain - \Dll : \Delta \strainsh - \Dllmod : \Delta \straincr \;
\end{equation}
in which the increment of shrinkage strain is:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:10}
	\Delta \strainsh =  \Delta \strainshCEB(t_{s}) \onell \;
\end{equation}
where $t_{s}$ represents the concrete curing time, and $\Delta \strainshCEB$ is the variation of magnitude of the concrete deformation by shrinkage, determined using the expressions of CEB-FIP MC90 [\citenum{CEB:1993}]. To calculate the increment of creep strain, denoted as $\Delta \straincr$, we use the incremental algorithm developed by Bažant and Prasannan [\citenum{bazant:1989a,bazant:1989b}], with an adjustment to incorporate CEB-FIP MC90 formulation. This adaptation is possible comparing the creep functions $J(t,t_0)$ of both references. This gives to the following equivalence:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:11}
	E_0 = E_c(t_0),~ \gamma_c(t-t_0)=\beta_c(t-t_0),~ \frac{1}{v(t)} = \frac{\phi_0}{E_{ci}} \text{  and  } \frac{1}{\eta(t)}=0 \;
\end{equation}
in which, according to Bažant and Prasannan [\citenum{bazant:1989a,bazant:1989b}], $E_0$  is the modulus of elasticity of the concrete aggregates and microscopic particles of the cement paste, $\gamma_c(t-t_0)$ is the microviscoelastic deformation of the volume fraction of solidified concrete $v(t)$, $\eta(t)$ is the apparent macroscopic viscosity and, according to CEB-FIP MC90 [\citenum{CEB:1993}], $E_c(t_0)$ is the tangent elastic modulus of the concrete at the instant of loading application $t_0$, $\beta_c(t-t_0)$  is a coefficient that depends on the loading age $t-t_0$ , $\phi_0$ is a coefficient that depends on the age of the concrete at the instant of loading application and $E_{ci}$  the tangent elasticity modulus of the concrete at the age of 28 day.


Details of this model, including validations and its application in single tunnel, are in [\citenum{quevedo2022}]. See [\citenum{quevedo2017comportamento}] for the algorithm details implemented in FORTRAN within the USERMAT subroutine.


\section{Spatial and time discretization of the domain}\label{}

The problem domain $\Omega$ consists of a twin deep tunnel with a cross gallery, as shown in Fig.~\ref{domain}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{Domain.pdf}
	\caption{Problem domain}
	\label{domain}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
The spatial discretization of the domain corresponds to a mesh with trilinear hexahedral elements (SOLID 185, 8 nodes), except in the gallery region, which uses higher-order tetrahedral elements (SOLID186, 10 nodes). Fig.~\ref{Mesh1} shows the mesh, geometric parameters, and boundary conditions for the domain problem. We considered front, side, and bottom symmetry to reduce computational cost. In this discretization, $d_1$ is the distance between longitudinal tunnel axes, $R_i$ longitudinal tunnel cross-section radius, $L_2$ total excavated length, $d_3$ domain height, $L_1$ length of the unexcavated region, $L_3$ transversal length of the domain, $L_p$ step length of the excavation process, $d_2$ position of the gallery along the longitudinal tunnel. In conjunction with boundary pressure $p$, we apply the initial stress condition $\stress_0 = -p\onell$ at all integration points to simulate the initial state of an undisturbed rock mass. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Mesh1.pdf}
	\caption{Mesh, dimensions and boundary conditions of the 3D twin tunnel domain}
	\label{Mesh1}
\end{figure}

We divided the mesh into two regions: one near the tunnel (light gray), which we refined more, and a region farther away (dark gray), which we increased the aspect ratio to minimize the number of elements in that region. Due to the low deformation gradient away from the tunnel wall, elements in this area can be considerably larger than in other regions. Fig.~\ref{Mesh2} presents the mesh at the cross-section of the longitudinal tunnel, with $e$ representing the thickness of the lining.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Mesh2.pdf}
	\caption{Detail 1 - Mesh in longitudinal tunnel cross-section with spacing $d_1=4R_i$}
	\label{Mesh2}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
One of the aspects investigated in this work is the influence of the spacing $d_1$ between longitudinal tunnels of the twin tunnel. Fig.~\ref{Mesh3} and Fig.~\ref{Mesh4} illustrate the spatial discretization in the gallery region and its connection with the longitudinal tunnel considering spacings $d_1 = 16R_i, 8R_i$ and $4R_i$, respectively. We adopt the radius of the gallery as $2/3R_i$, and its lining has the same thickness as the longitudinal tunnel. The dimensions $d_5$ and $d_1$ define the size of the transition region comprising tetrahedral elements between the gallery and the rest of the domain. Fig.~\ref{Mesh5} shows half of this transition region inside the rock mass.

	\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Mesh3.pdf}

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
Fig.~\ref{Mesh6} shows the mesh of the lining at the junction of the gallery and the longitudinal tunnel for $d1 = 4R_i, 8R_i,$ and $16R_i$. One noteworthy characteristic of this mesh is that it confines the tetrahedral elements within the contour of every excavation step.

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
The construction process is simulated through the deactivating and activating method, i.e., in each step of excavation, reducing the stiffness of the excavated element (multiply  by 1E-8) and active the lining elements at a distance $d_0$ from the excavation face (unlined length). With each excavation step, we execute the solution, and time advances based on the expression $t_p=L_p/V_p$, where $L_p$ represents the length of the excavation step, and $V_p$ is the speed of the excavation face. Fig.~\ref{Diagram of excavations} illustrates a schematic of the excavation process where $n_p$ is the number of excavation steps. In this Figure, $n_{pig}$ represents the number of steps excavated in the longitudinal tunnel that starts gallery excavation. Once reaching this step, we pause the excavation of the longitudinal tunnel, and the gallery excavation begins. In the gallery, $L_{p_1}$ is the step length of the gallery excavation, $V_{p_1}$ is the speed of the gallery excavation, and $d_{0_1}$ is the unlined length of the gallery. After completing the gallery excavation, the longitudinal tunnel excavation resumes. These parameters related to the geometry domain, excavation and installation of the lining are shown in Table~\ref{table1}.

During tunnel construction, we determine the initial time increment for solution steps as $0.5t_p$ (for the longitudinal tunnel) and $0.5t_{p_1}$ (for the transverse gallery). ANSYS manages the time increment using the bisection method, halving the time step if there is no equilibrium convergence.

After tunnel excavation, in time-dependent constitutive models, time continues to progress to capture long-term viscous effects. In this stage, each time step lasts 100 days, with an initial increment of 50 days. This increase, compared to the excavation time increments, is facilitated by the semi-implicit scheme in the viscoplasticity solution. The explicit scheme, as indicated in [\citenum{zienkiewicz1974visco}], requires a smaller time increment to the precision of the solution.


\section{Comparision with analytical solutions in twin tunnel}\label{}

To examine mesh convergence and validate the numerical model, we compared the numerical solution with the elastic and elastoplastic analytical solution in the plane state of deformations for twin tunnels. Guo et al. [\citenum{GUO2021}] develop an elastic analytical solution for the stress field around twin circular tunnels with hydrostatic pressure using the complex variable and the superposition principle. The Fig.~\ref{GUO_FIG1} shows the tangential stress distribution around the tunnel's boundary in this analytical solution with the numerical solution considering  $R_i = 4$ m, $E = 500$ MPa, $\nu =$ 0.23, $d_1 = 2R_i$, $p = 2.2$ MPa.

Ma et. al. [\citenum{MA2020}] developed an analytical solution for a perfectly plastic constitutive model with a Mohr-Coulomb surface. One of the results was the contour of the plastic zone for several conditions. Fig.~\ref{MA_FIG1} shows the comparison between the numerical model solution (taken from a section away from the excavation face) and the analytical solution. For these analysis, $R_i = 1$ m, Young's modulus $E=20$ GPa and Poisson's ratio $\nu = 0.3$.

Fig.~\ref{MA_FIG2} displays the magnitude of displacements, radial, orthoradial, and z-direction stresses at the element level  for the case with $c=5$ MPa, $d_1=5$ m, $\sigma_x = \sigma_y = 30$ MPa. We adopted a case without excavating the gallery to assess the quality of the mesh. The smoothness observed in the solution between the elements indicates satisfactory discretization.
