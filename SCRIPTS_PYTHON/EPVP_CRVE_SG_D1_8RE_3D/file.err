 After NUMMRG,NODE, node 55372 (and possibly others) is associated with  
 more than one solid model entity.  Future commands which depend on the

 During this session a solution was performed using 16 CPU cores in      
 shared-memory parallel (SMP) mode (-np 16).  It is strongly             
 recommended to use distributed memory parallel (DMP) mode instead       
 (-dis -np 16).  DMP mode typically outperforms SMP mode, even when      
 running on a single system.  For more information, see the ANSYS        
 Parallel Processing Guide in the ANSYS Help system.
