 Structural elements without mid nodes usually produce much more         
 accurate results in quad or brick shape.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      15.062   TIME= 13:30:14
 Mid-nodes of some elements have been modified to lie on straight edges  
 because of distortion with the original mid-nodes.  This condition is   
 sometimes eliminated by tetrahedron element improvement when enabled.   
 Issue ESEL,,STRAIGHTENED to select such elements for listing or         
 plotting.

 After NUMMRG,NODE, node 59320 (and possibly others) is associated with  
 more than one solid model entity.  Future commands which depend on the  
 node to solid model connectivity (meshing, mesh clearing, solid         
 boundary condition transfer, etc.) may not operate properly.            
 NUMMRG,KP may correct this problem.

 During this session a solution was performed using 16 CPU cores in      
 shared-memory parallel (SMP) mode (-np 16).  It is strongly             
 recommended to use distributed memory parallel (DMP) mode instead       
 (-dis -np 16).  DMP mode typically outperforms SMP mode, even when      
 running on a single system.  For more information, see the ANSYS        
 Parallel Processing Guide in the ANSYS Help system.
