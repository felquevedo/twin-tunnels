 During this session a solution was performed using 24 CPU cores in      
 shared-memory parallel (SMP) mode (-np 24).  It is strongly             
 recommended to use distributed memory parallel (DMP) mode instead       
 (-dis -np 24).  DMP mode typically outperforms SMP mode, even when      
 running on a single system.  For more information, see the ANSYS        
 Parallel Processing Guide in the ANSYS Help system.
