 After NUMMRG,NODE, node 52634 (and possibly others) is associated with  
 more than one solid model entity.  Future commands which depend on the  
 node to solid model connectivity (meshing, mesh clearing, solid         
 boundary condition transfer, etc.) may not operate properly.            
 NUMMRG,KP may correct this problem.

 During this session a solution was performed using 16 CPU cores in      
 shared-memory parallel (SMP) mode (-np 16).  It is strongly             
 recommended to use distributed memory parallel (DMP) mode instead       
 (-dis -np 16).  DMP mode typically outperforms SMP mode, even when      
 running on a single system.  For more information, see the ANSYS        
 Parallel Processing Guide in the ANSYS Help system.
