 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      18.359   TIME= 13:13:09
 Shape testing revealed that 6 of the 30 new or modified elements        
 violate shape warning limits.  To review test results, please see the   
 output file or issue the CHECK command.                                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      72.469   TIME= 13:13:31
 Previous testing revealed that 6 of the 4060 selected elements violate  
 shape warning limits.  To review warning messages, please see the       
 output or error file, or issue the CHECK command.                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      74.766   TIME= 13:13:39
 ANSYS,INC.-supplied version of coding for USERCK has been used.         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     121.375   TIME= 13:13:45
 Both solid model and finite element model boundary conditions have been 
 applied to this model.  As solid loads are transferred to the nodes or  
 elements, they can overwrite directly applied loads.

 The view for graph plots is currently NOT changeable.                   
  To enable graph view manipulation, issue /GROPTS,VIEW,1.               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =    1368.750   TIME= 13:39:38
 During this session a solution was performed using 12 CPU cores in      
 shared-memory parallel (SMP) mode (-np 12).  It is strongly             
 recommended to use distributed memory parallel (DMP) mode instead       
 (-dis -np 12).  DMP mode typically outperforms SMP mode, even when      
 running on a single system.  For more information, see the ANSYS        
 Parallel Processing Guide in the ANSYS Help system.
