 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.312   TIME= 14:52:51
 Shape testing revealed that 6 of the 30 new or modified elements        
 violate shape warning limits.  To review test results, please see the   
 output file or issue the CHECK command.                                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.656   TIME= 14:52:51
 Previous testing revealed that 6 of the 4060 selected elements violate  
 shape warning limits.  To review warning messages, please see the       
 output or error file, or issue the CHECK command.                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.844   TIME= 14:52:51
 ANSYS,INC.-supplied version of coding for USERCK has been used.         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      30.953   TIME= 14:52:53
 Both solid model and finite element model boundary conditions have been 
 applied to this model.  As solid loads are transferred to the nodes or  
 elements, they can overwrite directly applied loads.

 The view for graph plots is currently NOT changeable.                   
  To enable graph view manipulation, issue /GROPTS,VIEW,1.               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =    1118.156   TIME= 14:55:27
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 64%.       
 Often this indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or it indicates a particularly    
 slow hard drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run  
 faster on identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive   
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 ANSYS Performance Guide which is part of the ANSYS Help system.
